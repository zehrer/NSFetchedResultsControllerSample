NSFetchedResultsControllerSample is a iOS5 sample projct for the iPhone/iPod.

It shows how to use the NSFetchedResultsController for CoreData to-many relationships.
It is just based to the code created by the XCode 4.2.1 wizard. 

The datamodel is only the Event class refer itself (subItems) by a to-many relationship.

The advantage of using an NSFetchedResultsController for to-many relationship is you get the 
monitoring for deletes or updates for free and have a implementation with animations and not just a
simple view.reloadData version.
